# Changes for EU and UK customers

**tl;dr:** The Tindie platform does not currently offer a solution for the latest changes to the European Union import rules and regulations (IOSS) or for local tax collections (UK). To be able to provide service to our EU and UK customers, we will release stock on the [new Electrolama shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/) from mid-September. Until then, we can only fulfill orders from outside the UK and EU, via Tindie. If youâ€™re from the UK and EU and interested in buying our products, please sign up for the waitlists on the [Electrolama Shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/).    

Read below to find out how this came about and what it means for you in detail.

## ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º  New arrangements for customers in EU countries: IOSS
From 1<sup>st</sup> July 2021, the value added tax (VAT) exemption for the importation of goods into the EU with a value not exceeding EUR 22 will be removed. As a result, all goods imported into the EU will be subject to VAT. If the sale of goods to buyers in the EU is facilitated through an electronic interface, the electronic interface is considered to have made the sale and is in principle liable for the payment of VAT. The Import One-Stop Shop (IOSS) was created to facilitate and simplify the declaration and payment of VAT for distance sales of imported goods with a value not exceeding EUR 150. You can read more about it [here](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/77255bf8-65cd-11eb-aeb5-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-210200019). 

We are now registered for the IOSS scheme but as with any new complex system, there are currently a lot of problems reported online and we do not want to expose you to them. We are currently testing this new system by sending test packages to several friends of Electrolama residing in various EU member states. Once we can verify that these packages are delivered smoothly and the IOSS scheme glitches have been ironed out, we will start accepting orders from EU customers on the [Electrolama Shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/). Our current target for the launch of our online shop is mid-September.

If youâ€™re from the EU, this is how IOSS works:

  - <ins>For orders under â‚¬150</ins>: VAT will be collected as part of the checkout process and **you will not have to pay VAT or any unexpected handling charges imposed by your local postal service/delivery company upon delivery**. Simple!
  - <ins>For orders over â‚¬150</ins>: Orders over the value of â‚¬150 are liable for customs duty which is not covered by IOSS (a VAT system) therefore local customs, VAT and handling fees may apply upon the delivery of your package.


## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§  New arrangements for customers in the UK
You will receive VAT invoices for your purchases and will be able to pay in GBP.  You can order all Electrolama products through the [Electrolama Shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/) starting mid-September.


## What about the Tindie Shop?

We love Tindie and we will continue to sell to destinations outside the UK and EU on the platform for the time being, but as we keep developing more products they will be launched and kept in stock primarily in the [Electrolama Shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/). Please sign up for the waitlists on the [Electrolama Shop](https://shop.electrolama.com/) product pages.    

As always, thank you for your patience and support. These are not easy times to navigate for a small business started during the pandemic but we are growing and learning every day, and hopefully that reflects in our improved services.
