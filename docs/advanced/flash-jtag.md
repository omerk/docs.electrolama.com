title: Flash Firmware using c/JTAG
---

**Please Note**: <ins>For general purpose usage, you will not need an external debugger and [BSL method](/flash/flash-ti-flash-prog/) will be enough for your flashing needs</ins>. If you have accidentally disabled BSL on your stick by flashing it with an incompatible firmware, or if you are a firmware developer needing proper debugging facilities and/or want to get access to the RF tools in TI SmartRF Studio, follow along.


## cJTAG vs JTAG

TI's [newer generation chips](/guides/ti-part-numbers/) use cJTAG as the default debug interface. While it may look like it (reduced pin count on the debug header), **cJTAG is not SWD**. cJTAG (IEEE 1149.7) is an extension to the JTAG standard (IEEE 1149.1), that reduces the number of required pins by multiplexing the TMS, TDI and TDO signals on a single bi-directional pin, providing all the normal JTAG debug and test functionality ([ref](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/interface-description/#cjtag-compatibility)).

The debug header on zzh only exposes TMS/TCK and as such a cJTAG compatible debug adapter is needed. On zzhp and zzhp-lite (Rev B3 onwards), all pins are brought out to the debug header so you can use a JTAG compatible debug adapter.


## Flashing using CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG (or TI XDS110)

The cheapest option for an officially supported debugger is the [CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG](http://www.ti.com/tool/CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG), available from most common electronics distributors. Here'a handy pinout reference for CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG:

GUI tools to use with CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG are [SmartRF Flash Programmer v2](https://www.ti.com/tool/FLASH-PROGRAMMER) (recommended, Windows only) or [UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH) (cross-platform).


## Flashing using J-Link

Make sure power is provided to your stick (i.e: plug it in) and use "J-Link Commander" to erase and flash your stick: 


``` doscon
J-Link>connect ?
Please specify device / core. <Default>: ARM7
Type '?' for selection dialog
Device>?
Please specify target interface:
  J) JTAG (Default)
  S) SWD
  T) cJTAG
TIF>T
Device position in JTAG chain (IRPre,DRPre) <Default>: -1,-1 => Auto-detect
JTAGConf>
Specify target interface speed [kHz]. <Default>: 4000 kHz

**Error: "Selected interface (cJTAG) is not supported by the connected probe."**

It appears that some J-Link pods do not support cJTAG and this error message is displayed when performing the steps above. If this is the case, select JTAG as the target interface:

``` doscon
J-Link>connect ?
Please specify device / core. <Default>: ARM7
Type '?' for selection dialog
Device>?
Please specify target interface:
  J) JTAG (Default)
  S) SWD
  T) cJTAG
TIF>J
...
```

This won't work on zzh, as the extra pins needed for full JTAG are not brought out on the 5-pin debug header.
