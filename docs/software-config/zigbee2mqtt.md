# Zigbee2mqtt

Zigbee2mqtt has support for chips used on Electrolama sticks. Download the Z-Stack coordinator firmware from [@Koenkk's firmware repository](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware). The firmware you'll need can be found under `coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin/CC2652R_coordinator_<date>.zip`, as of writing the latest version available is `CC2652R_coordinator_20210120.zip`. Download and extract this and follow the ["firmware flashing instructions"](/radio-docs/#step-3-flash-the-firmware-on-your-stick) to burn this on your stick.

## Configuration

Make sure that the USB-serial bridge drivers are installed and your device is recognised ([instructions here](/radio-docs/drivers/)).

With the correct serial port in use identified, edit your Zigbee2mqtt `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
serial:
  port: /dev/ttyUSB0  #(change this if it is different on your machine)
advanced:
  rtscts: false
```

The `rtscts: false` directive does not appear in the default configuration file but is crucial for the operation of zzh so please **don't ignore that**. 

Also note that it sits in the `advanced:` config group and not in `serial:`.
